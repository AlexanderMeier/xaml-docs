# Suggested Actions Menu

The WPF XAML Designer includes a **Suggested Actions** menu that is similar to the [Smart Tags]({%slug common-smart-tags%}). The controls from the **Telerik.Windows.Controls** assembly support these actions for .NET projects. 

The Suggested Actions menu give you access to common properties of a control selected within the new WPF XAML Designer. To display the menu, click on a Telerik control in the designer and use the lightbulb icon to expand and interact with the Suggested Actions UI.
