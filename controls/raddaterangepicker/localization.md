# Localization

The built-in localization mechanism in the platform allows you to translate the `RadDateRangePicker` control based on the applied culture. 

The Telerik UI for WPF suite supports the following languages:

* English            
* German          
* Spanish           
* French
* Italian              
* Dutch             
* Turkish

To learn more about the ways to localize the Telerik controls, read the common [Localization]({%slug common-localization%}) article.
