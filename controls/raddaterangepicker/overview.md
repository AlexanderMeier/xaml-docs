# DateRangePicker Overview

The DateRangePicker component allows you to easily enrich your UI with a tool for selecting range of dates. This is helpful for scenarios where you need to extract a specific set of data related to a time range. For example, applications for booking hotels, showing graphs with sales data in specific ranges and more. 

{% if site.has_cta_panels == true %}
{% include cta-panel-overview.html %}
{% endif %}
