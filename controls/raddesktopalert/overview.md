# {{ site.framework_name }} DesktopAlert Overview

Thank you for choosing Telerik __RadDesktopAlert__!

__RadDesktopAlert__ is a WPF control that allows you to display notifications on the desktop if a specific event occurs in your application - new e-mail message, meeting request or task request is received. It is displayed as a small popup on a predetermined location for a short period of time and gets automatically closed after the elapsing of that time. By using __RadDesktopAlertManager__ multiple alerts could easily be displayed and managed. The manager also takes care of the proper positioning of the alerts.
