## Key Features

* **Syntax highlighting**: Provides syntax highlighting for procedural programming and markup languages. Also allows users to customize built-in languages or create highlighting for their own [custom language]({%slug radsyntaxeditor-features-custom-language%}).

* **Code outlining**: Displays code blocks in tree structure and allows users to expand and collapse the code blocks interactively for readability. RadSyntaxEditor automatically chooses where to create outlines for built-in languages. It also allows users to create outlining for their own syntax highlighting.

* **Undo and redo**: Includes support for undo and redo operations that erase the last change in a document and reinsert it.

* **IntelliPrompts**: RadSyntaxEditor can show IntelliPrompts for code completion and method overloading to speed up coding by reducing typos and other common mistakes.

* **Find and replace**: Users can replace the specified text with the replacement text as per the conditions specified. Includes options to replace the first occurrence or all occurrences of the search text.

* **Zooming**: Allows users to zoom in and out of the control up to 4 times the original font size.

* **Line numbers**: Displays the line number at the start of a line for the users to identify the current number.

* **Palettes**: The control comes with 4 different palettes from which you can choose from and allows for custom palettes to be created.
