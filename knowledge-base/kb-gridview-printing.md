## Description

How to display a print preview dialog and print the data of the RadGridView for WPF control.

## Solution

The RadGridView itself doesn't provide an automatic printing support. However, you can print the control by utilizing the [RadSpreadsheet component]({%slug radspreadsheet-overview%}). 

See a runnable example that shows how to do this in the [SDK Samples repository](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/GridView/PrintPreviewWithSpreadsheet).
