# Installing UI for Silverlight from ZIP File

The following topic describes what steps you should perform in order to install Telerik UI for Silverlight manually from a __ZIP__ file. The [ZIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_%28file_format%29) is used for manual (advanced) installs and upgrading/updating purposes.
      
For more information about which installation package you need to install, read [here]({%slug installation-installing-which-file-do-i-need%}).
        
For more information about the system requirements, read [here]({%slug installation-system-requirements%}).

## Downloading ZIP Package

1. Go to to the UI for Silverlight download page following the instructions in [Download Product Files]({%slug download-product-files%}) topic.               
2. Download the ZIP file and extract it in the desired location.

## Exploring the Extracted Folders

Once the archived folders are extracted you will probably note the following folder structure:

* __Binaries__ - the standard binaries including theme dlls.             
* __Binaries.NoXaml__ - binaries without XAML.              
* __LicenseAgreements__
* __Themes.Implicit__ - implicit styles friendly XAML.
              
>importantWith the Q1 2014 release we no longer provide the Themes and pdb files within the installation package. You could download them separately from the UI for Silverlight download page in your [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account.aspx).
              
>The Silverlight Demos application can be downloaded from the UI for Silverlight download page (in the [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account.aspx)) as a separate ZIP file as well.
