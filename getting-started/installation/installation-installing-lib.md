# Latest Internal Build

This article describes what is LIB and how to download it.

## What is LIB

The Latest Internal Build (LIB) is a regular minor release of the UI for {{ site.framework_name }} assemblies, that is uploaded once every few weeks. It is built against the latest development environment and contains all the newest bug fixes.

The purpose of the LIB is to allow the users to test the latest bug fixes. So, if you have experienced any problem with the current official distributions there is a possibility that the issue has already been addressed in the latest internal build. 

>important The LIB are intended for development only and are not recommended for production purposes as these distributions have not gone through the complete QA process.

>tip Features are usually not included in the LIB.

## Downloading the LIB
