The Telerik UI for WPF product provides several different sets of assemblies (distributions) built against different .NET versions. This article lists the versions used to build the Telerik dlls and in what .NET runtime versions you can use them.

>important With the Q2 2024 release, the __.NET Core 3.1, .NET Framework 4.0 and 4.5__ will be deprecated, as an act to align the Telerik UI for WPF product with Microsoft's recommended framework versions. Read more about this decision in the [following blog post](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/embracing-future-product-update-enhanced-performance-and-security). The minimum version in the releases after this change takes effect will be, .NET 6 for the .NET users and .NET Framework 4.6.2 for the .NET Framework users. Additionally, Microsoft documentation provides a [guide for upgrading to .NET Framework 4.6.2 and later](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/).
